<h2>26.	Risk Management in Forex Trading?</h2>
<p>The risks can be high but also controllable. Forex traders around the world are competing against other forex traders, banks, and institutional traders who are seeking the same potential rewards from their own trading activities. Money management, discipline, talent, and a lack of emotion are traits you will want to develop in FOREX trading. But remember, FOREX Trading is speculative and any capital used should be risk capital. In fact, we recommend that you trade on a demo account until you have shown profit for at least three consecutive months before trading real money.</p><br/>
<h2>27.	What is Spread in Forex Trading ?</h2>
<p>The spread is the amount of pips between the bidding price and the asking price is called the spread. The spread is what forex brokers use to make money on every forex trade placed through their network .As example, the forex broker may be paying a price of 1.3500 for buying or selling. The broker will then allow you to buy the currency for 1.3501 or sell it for 1.3499. The spread always stays around the actual price that the forex broker is paying. So when you buy, you get one end of the spread and when you sell you get the other end of it, and vice versa. By the time you close your trade, you will have always paid the spread. Spread depends on the broker houses and globalforexsignal does not have any say regarding spread it solely depends on market and broker houses. Global forex signal supports MT4 trading platform in any broker that is comfortable and reliable to the traders.</p><br/>
